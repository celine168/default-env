# Rich Default Environment

This environment is based on the
[Jupyter Datascience Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/datascience-notebook)
and 
[Jupyter Scipy Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/scipy-notebook).
It builds on top of a tagged version of the 
[Jupyter Minimal Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/minimal-notebook).

At the moment, this contains the Python, R, Julia, Octave, and SageMath environments.
Since SageMath relies on Python 2, both Python 3 and 2 are supported.

## How to Build a New Image
First, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/). The
community edition should suffice.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LibreTexts/default-env.git`. 
The Dockerfile for the Default Environment is stored in `~/rich-default/Dockerfile`.

Edit the Dockerfile, then build by running `docker build -t libretexts/<image name>:<tagname> .`
I typically build to an image name of `default-test` and a relevant tag to test first,
then later build the same image to `default-env` with sequential version number as the tag.

Push the Dockerfile to DockerHub by running `docker push libretexts/<image name>:<tagname>`.
Use the LibreTexts login credentials when pushing.
If you're getting errors logging into DockerHub, check out 
[this troubleshooting page](https://github.com/LibreTexts/metalc/blob/master/docs/Bare-Metal/troubleshooting/Repo2DockerErrors.md). 

To push to DockerHub, run `docker push libretexts/<image name>:<tagname>`.
If you go to DockerHub, you should see your image and tag pushed.

**Note:** We use the image [default-env](https://cloud.docker.com/u/libretexts/repository/docker/libretexts/default-env)
to denote Docker builds intended for the Default Environment. Tags are labeled
by version numbers (i.e. 1.0, 1.1, etc.).

The image [default-test](https://cloud.docker.com/u/libretexts/repository/docker/libretexts/default-test)
is used for temporary test Docker builds. I use relevant, memorable tags.
I suggest testing the environment out on a staging JupyterHub before deploying
on the production cluster.

After testing, change the Default Environment on the production cluster
by editing `config.yaml`.
```
singleuser:
  defaultUrl: "/lab"
  ...
  image:
    name: libretexts/default-env # You shouldn't need to change the image name.
    tag: "1.7"  # Change the tag of the Docker image here!
  profileList:
    - display_name: "Default Environment"
      description: "With Python, R, Julia, Octave, and SageMath. Includes packages requested by the community."
      default: true
  ...
```

## RStudio
You can access RStudio through JupyterHub! Change `/lab` to `/rstudio` in
the URL after spawning your server. (This [issue](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues/990)
helped install RStudio.)
